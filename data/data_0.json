He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong.\nToday, in Kyiv, I am meeting with President Zelenskyy and his team for an extended discussion on our support for Ukraine. I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia\u2019s war machine. Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support \u2013 and that support will endure.\nI also look forward to traveling on to Poland to meet President Duda and the leaders of our Eastern Flank Allies, as well as deliver remarks on how the United States will continue to rally the world to support the people of Ukraine and the core values of human rights and dignity in the UN Charter that unite us worldwide.\n###\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/19/readout-of-forum-with-hbcu-student-veterans-and-cadets/\nStay Connected\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\nhttps://my.community.com/potus?t=Hello%20Mr.%20President%20%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fbriefing-room%2Fstatements-releases%2F2023%2F02%2F20%2Fstatement-from-president-joe-biden-on-travel-to-kyiv-ukraine%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook&t=Statement+from+President+Joe+Biden+on+Travel+to+Kyiv%2C+Ukraine\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=whitehouse&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fbriefing-room%2Fstatements-releases%2F2023%2F02%2F20%2Fstatement-from-president-joe-biden-on-travel-to-kyiv-ukraine%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter&text=Statement+from+President+Joe+Biden+on+Travel+to+Kyiv%2C+Ukraine\nHome\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/\nThe Administration\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/\nExecutive Offices\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/executive-office-of-the-president/\nPriorities\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/priorities/\nThe Record\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/therecord/\nBriefing Room\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/\nThe White House\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/\nDisclosures\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/\nGet Involved\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/\nEspa\u00f1ol\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/es/\nContact Us\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/\nPrivacy Policy\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy/\nCopyright Policy\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright/\nAccessibility Statement\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/accessibility/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/whitehouse/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/\nhttps://twitter.com/whitehouse\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/\n#content", "image": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wh_social-share.png", "favicon": "/favicon.ico", "sitename": "The White House", "color": null, "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/20/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-travel-to-kyiv-ukraine/"}
